Raspberry Leaf aka GPIO Reference Board, is a small reference card,
mounted on top of the GPIO pins - good thing for humanitarians like me, "an 
extremely cheap way to avoid making potentially fatal mistakes when prototyping".
Adafruit [sells](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1432) pretty one, but $2.95 + xN shipping
is kinda overprice for me, so I went printing one myself, taking initial png file from
[here](http://www.pi-supply.com/raspberry-leaf-time-saving-gpio-reference-guide/).
and tuning it a bit using mad M$Paint skillz (original was little too wide).
This one is for rev.2 boards pinout:

Sticking it with a clear tape to the thin PVC and drilling the holes:

</a></p>

Result is not exactly chef-d'oeuvre of industrial design, but it works:
